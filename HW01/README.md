# BME595-HW01
2D Convolution with Lua.
## Result Images
The following result images are generated by convolving a random 9x9 kernel (`torch.rand(9,9)`) with only the Y channel of the *Lena* image in three different sizes.
* 128x128

## Performance Comparision
The following bar graph compares the average duration by the two operations.
Blue bars represents `C_conv` and red bars represents `Lua_conv` in seconds.

Parallelized `C_conv` function accelerates the convolution by three orders of magnitude, compared to `Lua_conv` function.
