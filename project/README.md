# Breast Cancer Detection Using CNN
## Abstract
Breast cancer has been one of the dealiest and most frequent cancer type. Moreover, its diagnosis heavily relies on visual inspection of whole-slides by physicians. Aiming to reduce the manual labor, in this work, we implemented a deep learning frame work that preprocesses raw gigabyte-sized whole-slide images and automatically detects cancerous regions using ResNet. Then, we show the practical effectiveness of our framework by ROC plots. Finally, we compare the performances of two different CNN models on two datasets with different sizes.
